# Readme: example-spring-hello-world (raw Java build)
An example of the classic "Hello World!" program in 'Spring style', as described in the _Pro Spring_ book from Apress. Consequently, this is a decoupled design, with externalized specification of the concrete classes that will ultimately be used. 

#Requirements
The code has one explicit library dependency on Spring Core, which in turn has a dependency on commons-logging:

*   spring-core-1.0.2.jar
*   commons-logging-1.2.jar

(Use Intellij Download Tool to download copies of these libraries to your local project directory structure.)
 


#Building the project
You will need:

*   Java JDK 8 (or higher)

An Intellij project file is included in the repo, which can be view and build the project but Java is the only actual requirement to build the project.

#Notes
An Intellij project file is included in the root directory of the project.
